###An interactive visualization for qualitative accounting

We want to look beyond purely monetary measures of value, and measure and integrate indicators that are both quantitative and qualitative. Consider, for example, longevity in a population. This is a brute average number (quantity), but it indicates something about the quality of health and security enjoyed by the population (quality). We categorize the indicators according to thee abstract and general qualities (taking inspiration from the three Gunas of Hindu philosophy): the Pure, the Passionate, and the Dark. 
 
A web-based app, the [Cultural Compass](http://ignorantlibrarian.github.io/culturalcompass/) allows the user to manipulate multiple indicators of value as vectors, which can then be represented as one arrow: a compass measure of length and direction, showing the integration of the qualitative and quantitative aspects. The compass is intended to be used iteratively, with successive refinements to the quantitative and qualitative aspects helping to guide and clarify policy decisions.
